# Splendor - Software Development Project I (2022-2023)

Our team of three developers collaborated to create a digital version of the popular board game Splendor using Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project was organized into distinct layers to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase. At the core, we implemented a domain layer comprising Repository classes and a DomainController, facilitating clean separation of concerns and easy management of game logic.

We integrated a persistence layer featuring mappers to the database, enabling seamless data management and storage. Our graphical user interface (GUI) layer was developed using JavaFX, providing players with an intuitive and visually appealing gaming experience.

In addition to robust architecture, we prioritized error handling by implementing exceptions to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios. To ensure code quality and reliability, we extensively utilized unit tests, validating the functionality of individual components and ensuring the overall stability of the application. This project not only demonstrates our proficiency in Java programming but also showcases our ability to collaborate effectively and deliver a polished digital gaming experience.
